## Comments

It was easy, but because of my work today I had time to dedicate myself to the challenge.

I made this api using [nestjs](https://docs.nestjs.com/), docker and postgres database.

I had a difficulty when I wanted to import the csv data, because it had reference errors. So, I removed all the foreign keys in the entities.

I hope this project is successful and exceeds your expectations. ðŸ‘‹
